This section introduces the fundamentals of modern web applications, starting with general course information and the basics of how web apps work. It covers core concepts such as HTTP GET and POST requests, the difference between traditional and single-page applications (SPAs), and how JavaScript enables dynamic interaction through event handlers and callbacks.

You'll explore how web pages are structured using the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it directly from the browser console. The section also reviews how browsers load JavaScript, the role of CSS in styling, and the use of AJAX for asynchronous data fetching. It provides a high-level overview of JavaScript libraries and the full-stack development model, while briefly touching on the concept of "JavaScript fatigue", the overwhelming number of tools and frameworks in the ecosystem. Exercises 0.1â€“0.6 help reinforce these foundational topics.
