In a typical CI (Continuous Integration) setup, the main steps include linting, testing, and building. The choice of tools depends heavily on the programming language and ecosystem. For example, in a JavaScript/Node.js environment, linting is often handled with ESLint, which checks code quality and enforces style rules. For testing, Jest or Mocha are widely used frameworks that provide unit testing, integration testing, and even snapshot testing. The building step often relies on tools like Webpack, Rollup, or even the built-in scripts of frameworks (such as React’s npm run build) to bundle and optimize the code for production.

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are several alternatives for setting up CI pipelines. GitLab CI/CD is a strong option, especially if the repository is hosted on GitLab. CircleCI and Travis CI are popular cloud-based services that integrate easily with GitHub and Bitbucket. Azure Pipelines and AWS CodePipeline are also common for teams already working in Microsoft or Amazon ecosystems. For self-hosted solutions, Drone CI and TeamCity are frequently used.

When deciding between a self-hosted or cloud-based CI setup, the best option depends on context. Cloud-based CI usually offers easier setup, scalability, and maintenance, making it suitable for small to medium teams. Self-hosted CI might be better if the project involves sensitive code, strict compliance requirements, or when the organization already has strong infrastructure. To make this decision, I would need information about the project’s budget, security requirements, team size, and expected scale.
