**ðŸ“š Part Overview**
In this part, our focus shifts to the backend, where we will implement server-side functionality for a phonebook application with a front end in part 2.

We will build a simple REST API using Node.js and the Express framework. The applicationâ€™s data will be stored in a MongoDB database.

By the end of this part, we will also deploy the application to the internet using [Render](https://render.com). This is the phonebook link: https://fullstackopen-nodeserver.onrender.com/
